BITCOIN HISTORICAL DATA

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

1.1.	Background and Motivations
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a peer-to-peer network and allows for secure, anonymous, and borderless transactions without the need for a centralized authority.
Bitcoin's popularity has grown tremendously over the years, and it has become a mainstream asset class with a market capitalization of over $1 trillion. The price of Bitcoin has been highly volatile, and it has experienced several price bubbles and crashes throughout its history.
To better understand the historical price trends of Bitcoin, several exchanges began offering minute-to-minute updates of Bitcoin's Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) prices, volume in BTC and indicated currency. These exchanges provided historical data from September 2014 to October 2020 in CSV format, which allowed analysts to analyze and visualize the data.
The availability of such data has allowed for the development of several data analysis and visualization tools that can be used to better understand the trends and patterns of Bitcoin prices. The minute-to-minute data provides a high level of granularity that enables analysts to identify short-term fluctuations in prices and identify potential trading opportunities.
The motivations for analyzing Bitcoin historical data are varied. For investors, it provides a way to evaluate the performance of their investments and make informed decisions about buying or selling Bitcoin. Traders can use the data to identify short-term price trends and patterns to make profitable trades.
Academics can use the data to study the economic and behavioral aspects of Bitcoin, such as market efficiency, market manipulation, and price discovery. Policymakers can use the data to better understand the impact of Bitcoin on the economy and formulate regulations to mitigate potential risks associated with the cryptocurrency.
To make it easier for analysts to manipulate and visualize Bitcoin historical data, several web-based applications have been developed. These tools allow users to import the CSV files and create charts and graphs to visualize the data. Users can also filter and sort the data to focus on specific time periods or metrics.
In summary, the availability of minute-to-minute historical data for Bitcoin has enabled analysts to study the crypto currency's performance and identify trends and patterns that can inform investment decisions, trading strategies, and policy formulation. The development of web-based tools has made it easier to manipulate and visualize the data, making it accessible to a wider audience.


1.2.	Objectives
The objectives of collecting Bitcoin historical data for select Bitcoin exchanges are as follows: 
-	Historical Analysis: The first objective of collecting Bitcoin historical data is to enable historical analysis of Bitcoin prices and trends. By collecting data on minute-to-minute updates of OHLC, Volume in BTC and indicated currency, and weighted Bitcoin price, researchers and analysts can study the patterns and trends of Bitcoin prices over time and identify the factors that have contributed to the growth or decline of Bitcoin prices. 
-	Trading Strategies: Another objective of collecting Bitcoin historical data is to enable the development of trading strategies. By analyzing historical Bitcoin prices and trends, traders can develop trading strategies based on technical analysis or other quantitative approaches. The minute-to-minute updates of OHLC and Volume in BTC also provide traders with real-time market data that they can use to make informed trading decisions. 
-	Data Visualization: A third objective of collecting Bitcoin historical data is to support data manipulation and visualization. By building a small web page to support data manipulation and visualization, users can interact with the data and generate visualizations that help them better understand the patterns and trends in Bitcoin prices over time. 
-	Algorithmic Trading: A fourth objective of collecting Bitcoin historical data is to enable algorithmic trading. By using historical data and real-time updates of OHLC and Volume in BTC, traders can develop algorithms that automatically execute trades based on pre-defined trading strategies. 

Overall, the collection of Bitcoin historical data with CSV files and minute-to-minute updates of OHLC, Volume in BTC and indicated currency, and weighted Bitcoin price is crucial for studying the growth and trends of Bitcoin, developing trading strategies, and enabling algorithmic trading. By building a web page to support data manipulation and visualization, users can interact with the data and generate visualizations that help them better understand the patterns and trends in Bitcoin prices over time.

Analysis of Bitcoin charts

3.1.	Candlestick Chart of Bitcoin

The data used for this analysis is based on Bitcoin's candlestick chart. It includes the following information for each day:
o	Open Price: The open price represents the initial price traded when a new candle is formed. If the price starts to rise, the candle will be displayed in black. Conversely, if the price decreases, the candle will be displayed in red.
o	High Price: The upper wick/shadow's highest point indicates the highest price traded within the given period. If there is no upper wick/shadow, it means that either the open price or the close price was the highest price traded.
o	Low Price: The lowest price traded is either the price at the bottom of the lower wick/shadow, or if there is no lower wick/shadow, it is the same as the close price or open price in a bullish candle.
o	Close Price: The close price represents the final price traded during the candle's formation period. In most charting packages, if the close price is lower than the open price, the candle will be displayed in red by default. Conversely, if the close price is higher than the open price, the candle will be displayed in black.

3.4.1.	 Data analyst

During the observed period from 2014 to 2022, both the low price and high price of Bitcoin exhibited a general upward trend. This means that regardless of whether we consider the lower or higher range of prices, Bitcoin demonstrated an overall positive movement over the years.
The values of low price and high price generally increase steadily from the beginning to the beginning of the 2021 and strong volatility to the end.

The times that have strong volatility have greater distance from low price and high price of one day. These periods of strong volatility in Bitcoin's price range are characterized by significant fluctuations and rapid price movements. During these times, there is a greater distance between the low price and high price of Bitcoin on a given day. This means that the price can change by more than 30% within a single day, exemplified by the extreme price swings witnessed on May 19th, 2021, where the high price reached 43.5k and the low price dropped to 30.7k.

When the trends of low price and high price align closely, they move in parallel. At that time, the overall price did not change so much. In other words, the range between the lowest and highest prices remained relatively stable, indicating a period of consolidation or decreased volatility.

3.4.2.	 Data insight
The price of Bitcoin has been on a general upward trend since 2014.

There have been several periods of volatility in the price of Bitcoin, including a major crash in 2018.

The future price of Bitcoin is uncertain, but there is potential for further growth.

3.4.3.	 Conclusion

Understanding the historical trends and volatility in Bitcoin's price range can provide insights into its past behavior. However, it is important to exercise caution when using historical data to make predictions about future price movements, as the cryptocurrency market remains highly unpredictable and subject to various external factors. Therefore, it is advisable for individuals interested in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency investment to conduct thorough research, exercise prudent risk management, and seek guidance from financial professionals before making any investment decisions.
